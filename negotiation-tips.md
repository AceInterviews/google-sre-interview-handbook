> **"Because confidence is a technical skill."**

Negotiation isn't about being greedy. It's about knowing your market value. This cheat sheet gives you the scripts to handle the most common recruiter questions.

## 1. When Recruiter Asks: "What’s your expected compensation?"

**🚫 Don't say:** "$200k." (Don't give a number first).

**✅ Do say:** "I’m focusing on roles aligned with my skills and level. I’m confident your compensation team has a calibrated range for this band. I’d prefer to understand the scope first before discussing numbers."

**Why:** This deflects the "anchor" and forces them to make the first offer.

## 2. When You Get the Offer

**🚫 Don't say:** "Okay, I accept!" (Too fast).

**✅ Do say:** "This is a great starting point — I’m genuinely excited about the role. I need a day or two to review the details with my family. Can you send the full breakdown in writing?"

**Why:** This buys you time to strategize and counter-offer.

## 3. The "Magic Question" for Counter-Offers

**The Script:**
"I really value the team fit and mission. Based on market data for [Level] SRE roles, I was hoping to see something closer to [Target Number] to make this an easy 'Yes' today. **Is this the most competitive package we can put together?**"

**Why:** It is polite, data-driven, and collaborative.
