# 💰 Google SRE Salary Negotiation Pocket Card

> **"Because confidence is a technical skill."**

Google SRE negotiation is not about aggression.
It is about **signal management, calibration, and timing**.

This pocket card gives you **exact scripts** that align with how Google recruiters and compensation committees actually operate.

Use it verbatim.

## 1️⃣ When the Recruiter Asks:
### “What’s your expected compensation?”

**🚫 Don’t say:**  
“$200k.”  
(You anchor yourself — and lose leverage immediately.)

**✅ Do say:**  
“I’m focusing on roles aligned with my scope and level.  
I know Google has well-calibrated bands for SRE roles, so I’d prefer to understand the team, expectations, and leveling before discussing numbers.”

**Why this works**
- Signals seniority
- Avoids anchoring
- Pushes the first number to Google (where leverage belongs)

Recruiters are trained to accept this response.

## 2️⃣ When You Receive the Initial Offer

**🚫 Don’t say:**  
“Sounds good, I accept.”

**✅ Do say:**  
“This is a great starting point — I’m genuinely excited about the role.  
I’d like a day or two to review the full details carefully. Could you send the complete breakdown in writing?”

**Why this matters**
- Buying time is mandatory, not optional
- Compensation adjustments happen *after* the first offer
- Google expects candidates to review, not react

Accepting instantly removes negotiation surface.

## 3️⃣ The Only Counter-Offer Question That Works

### The Script

“I’m very excited about the team and the problem space.  
Based on market data for **[L4 / L5 / L6] SRE roles** and my background, I was hoping for something closer to **[target range]** to make this an easy yes.  

**Is this the most competitive package we can put together?**”

**Why this works**
- Collaborative, not confrontational
- Mentions level calibration (important at Google)
- Invites internal advocacy from the recruiter

This question keeps the conversation open instead of defensive.

---

## 4️⃣ Google-Specific Negotiation Reality (Most Candidates Miss This)

- Base salary has limited movement
- **Equity (RSUs)** is where flexibility exists
- Signing bonus is often the easiest lever
- Leveling adjustments matter more than small dollar tweaks

Strong candidates negotiate **structure**, not just numbers.

---

## 5️⃣ What NOT to Say (Instant Red Flags)

- “Another company is paying me more” (without proof)
- “I deserve this because I worked hard”
- “I need more money to justify leaving my job”
- “Can you just bump it a bit?”

Google rewards **data, calmness, and clarity** — not pressure.

---

## 🎯 Final Reminder

Negotiation is not a personality test.
It is a **measured extension of the interview**.

The same traits Google evaluates in SRE interviews apply here:
- clarity
- judgment
- restraint
- confidence without entitlement
